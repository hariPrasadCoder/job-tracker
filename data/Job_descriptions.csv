At Pawlicy Advisor, personalized advice from the most trustworthy experts ensures pets get the best care possible.Pawlicy Advisor is a fast-growing, fully-remote, venture-backed startup focused on helping pet owners around the country find the right health products for their pets, starting with pet health insurance. Pet insurance’s popularity is growing rapidly as pet owners seek protection from the high cost of veterinary care. Our pet insurance marketplace takes into account a pet’s breed-specific health risks to help people find the right policy for their pet. We also save pet owners money by analyzing pricing differences and premium increases over the lifetime of an animal.We market to pet parents through a number of channels, but the partners we value the most are veterinarians. Vets want their patients to have pet insurance because it increases that chance a pet parent will be able to afford the cost of treatment… but they don’t know what providers to recommend, and don’t want the liability associated with recommending a specific brand. Pawlicy Advisor helps thousands of vet offices across the US by simplifying the treatment financing conversation.Founded in 2018, Pawlicy Advisor is headquartered near NYC and the majority of the company operates remotely. You can learn more about us at https://www.pawlicy.com/about-us/FAQWhere is the Pawlicy Advisor team located?Pawlicy is headquartered in NYC and the majority of the team operates remotely. Some of us are in the NYC area, but most of the team is pretty spread out (Georgia, California, North Carolina, etc). We do company offsites on a regular basis where we fly the whole team out to a fun destination and spend a few days team building.

287,Accountant,"Not Beauty As UsualVintner’s Daughter is different.Frustrated with an industry that misled its customers and cared more about marketing than quality, April Gargiulo founded Vintner’s Daughter to provide unprecedented quality, craftsmanship and performance. She ended up transforming an industry.It took an outsider to reconsider what was possibleApril’s unusual background in fine winemaking in Napa Valley spurred her to question and challenge every industry norm. She asked: “When developing a skincare formulation, what if every decision was the highest quality, most effective option—regardless of cost or complexity?”The result of this exploration led to skincare products that delivered unprecedented skin nutrition and performance. When April searched for a lab to make its first product, Active Botanical Serum, she received dozens of “no’s.” Many very condescendingly told her how naive she was and did she have any idea how expensive, risky and time-consuming this would be. Despite the pressure to conform to industry norms, she resisted the urge to compromise on quality in any way.A lasting impactVintner's Daughter has taken a stand and is committed to creating confidence in an industry that uses fear and insecurity to sell and market its products. We do not use words like “correct,” “fix,” “transform,” “improve” or “anti-aging” that stoke insecurity or fear to drive purchase. Instead, we choose Positive Beauty, with words and images that manifest joy, confidence and gratitude in our beautiful skin.From our first sale, we have donated 2% of revenue to charities supporting women and children.

492,Frontend Engineer,"The RoleWe're looking for an experienced frontend engineer. We want someone with programming (and ideally also design) chops who can own the frontend and take our product to the next level as we scale.We're building a PaaS that runs in a user's own cloud (basically Heroku on k8s) and we've converted some of Heroku's largest enterprise users as well as a large base of high-growth startups despite starting just a little over a year ago.Now that we're hitting our stride, we're focused on capturing as much mindshare as possible, so we need someone who can take the polish and devX of our PaaS to the next level.This role would involve maximum ownership. Our entire engineering team is currently full-stack (leaning backend) or on infra side. I (Justin) do most of the day-to-day FE/UX work as a founder, so we want someone with more experience who can do it worlds better.You WillObsess over delivering the best possible user flow for teams on PorterElevate the design language of our platformIncrementally refactor the frontend without hampering the team's velocityRaise the standard for code quality and our engineering cultureSome Of The Technical Challenges We FaceRock solid UI/UX for onboarding - our platform automatically provisions resources to the user's cloud account and needs to robustly handle a variety of permissions and infra-related errors.Abstracting CI and Kubernetes - any PaaS spans a variety of use cases, so building a consistent and useful layer of abstraction requires constant awareness of the needs of many user profiles.Auto-Generated Frontend - each of our app/add-on templates uses a form.yaml file that programmatically generates a settings UI on the dashboard using a library of our own input primitives. Expanding and testing the functionality of these templates is non-trivial.Tech StackWeb: React (styled-components), TypeScriptBackend: Go, Kubernetes + Helm APIs, Postgres, RedisInfrastructure: AWS, GCPPorter is open source.

562,Global Supply Manager,"What we’re buildingOur vision is to electrify all waterborne vessels, and we're starting with electric water sport boats.Gas boats dominate today’s marine industry not because of great product offerings but because of a lack of better alternatives. Boaters have grown accustomed to vehicles that feel stuck in the 1980s: unreliable, expensive, loud, noxious, and a nightmare to own and operate. They’re also awful for the water and air they reside in.By contrast, electric boats are superior in nearly every way: not only are they far more reliable and less costly to operate, but they’re also quieter, quicker, and cleaner, with no fumes or pollutants. However, they’ve been held back by both the technology and the talent to make them truly competitive with gas alternatives. That’s Arc’s opportunity.Using modern, aerospace- and automotive-inspired techniques, we’re building our hulls, batteries, cooling systems, firmware, and software together to deliver the next generation of watercraft.What we’re looking forWe’re looking for someone that is excited by our vision, eager for the challenge, and willing to learn on the job.

We've developed an AI-powered kitchen robot named Flippy which automates the most repetitive of kitchen tasks, such as operating a deep fryer.
